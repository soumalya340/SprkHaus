**Overall Idea**: Imagine a community-powered event platform where NFT purchases equate to investing in exciting event ventures. Users can either create events themselves or propose them to the community. Event organizers may need to stake to ensure trust, with validation methods tailored to each scenario. Additionally, crowdfunding events offer NFT holders revenue-sharing opportunities, and a user-friendly app ensures transparent profit-sharing. This innovative platform brings together community-driven event creation, crowdfunding, and NFT investments in a seamless and secure manner.
